    "* A game can be defined by the **initial state**  (how the board is set up), the legal **actions** in each state, the **result** of each action, a **terminal test** (game over), and a utility function that applies to **terminal states**\n",
    "* In two-player zero-sum games with **perfect information**, the **minimax** algorithm can select optimal moves by a depth-first enumeration of the game tree.\n",
    "* The **alpha-beta** search algorithm computes the same optimal move as **minimax**, but achieves much greater efficiency by eliminating subtrees that are provably irrelevant.\n",
    "* Usually, it is not feasible to consider the whole game tree (even with alpha-beta), so we need to cut the search off at some point and apply a heuristic **evaluation function** that estimates the utility of a state.\n",
    "* Many game programs precompute tables of best moves in the opening and endgame so that they can look up a move rather than search.\n",
    "* Games of chance can be handled by an extension to the **minimax** algorithm that evaluates a **chance node** by taking the average utility of all its children, weighted by the probability of each child.\n",
    "* Optimal play in games of **imperfect information**, such as bridge, requires reasoning about the current and future **belief states** of each player. A simple approximation can be obtained by averaging the value of an action over each possible configuration of missing information.\n",
