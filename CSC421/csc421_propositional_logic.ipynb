    "# INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW \n",
    "Knowledge-based agents use a process of **reasoning** over an internal **representation** of knowledge to decide what actions to take. \n",
    "\n",
    "The key insight is that by using a factored representation (like we did in CSP problems) some parts of the agent can work in a domain-independent fashion. That way information can be combined in different ways, and the agents can adapt to new environments and explicitly describe goals. \n",
    "\n",
    "We begin by exploring **propositional logic** which is a less expressive subset of **first-order logic**. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**KNOWLEDGE BASE** is a set of sentences in some kind of **knowledge representation language**. **Axioms** are sentences that are given. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **TELL**: adds sentences to the KB \n",
    "2. **ASK**: a question of the knowledge base KB\n",
    "3. **inference**: derives new sentences from old sentences - can be used in either **TELL** or **ASK**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A **declarative** approach to system building only **TELLS** what the system needs to know and the system figures out **how** to accomplish a particular task. In contrast, a **procedural** approach encodes the desired behaviours directly as program code. In the 1970s and 1980s, advocates of these two approaches engaged in heated debates. Most successful agents often combine both declarative and procedural elements in their design. "
