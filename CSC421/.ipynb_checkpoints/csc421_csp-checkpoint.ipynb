    "\n",
    "Problems we've seen so far can be solved by searching the state space. These problems had a state space where the nodes were states and the edges between them were actions. Domain-specific heuristics can be used to estimate the cost of reaching the goal from a given state to make searching for solutions more efficient. The state representation is, in a sense, treated as a black box. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Constraint Satisfaction Problems** are a specific type of problem in which the state representation is **factored**. The state in such problems can be represented as a set of **variables** each of which has a **value** from a particular **domain**. A problem is solved when each variable has a value that satisfies all the constraints that involve that variable. "
